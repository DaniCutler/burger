Eat-da-Burger
This is a browser restaurant app that lets users create burgers they would like to "eat". When the user creates a name it displays the name. The user can create as many burgers as they would like. Then they would be able to "devour" the burger once created. There are create and eat buttons as well as pictures for each button. When the user clicks on a burger to be eatein it will also show in a list of burgers that were eaten.
